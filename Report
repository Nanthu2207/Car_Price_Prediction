Objective:
   The objective of this project was to develop a machine learning model to predict used car prices based on multiple features, including mileage, engine size, and car age.
The project utilized Random Forest and Ridge regression models.
After hyperparameter tuning, the Random Forest model achieved a test score of 0.8894 and a train score of 0.9756. 
The model will be deployed using Streamlit to provide real-time predictions.

Data Collection:
  * My data set have 44 columns and 6285 rows.The columns like Mileage,price,Year of Manufacture , Entertainment,wheel base etc.
  * These features were used to predict the car price in INR.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  Summary Statistics:
    * Provide basic statistics (mean, median, mode) for key features.
  Visualizations: 
   * Include visualizations such as histograms, bar charts, box plots, correlation heatmaps, etc.
  Insights: 
   * During the EDA, it was observed that cars with diesel engines tend to be priced higher on average compared to those with petrol engines.
   * Older cars have a decreasing trend in price, but mileage is a stronger factor in determining price.


Modeling Approach

Data Preprocessing: 
  * This may include handling missing data, scaling features, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

Models Used:
  * I used Random Forest ,Decision Tree ,Linear Regression and Gradient Boost.Random forest Regressor performance a good accuracy of 88.5%.
  * Then I choose Random Forest Regressor.
  * This model performed hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV) give max depth = 12,train-test split =3.

Model Evaluation Metrics:
  * Describe the metrics used to evaluate the models, such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), etc.
  * The Random Forest model was selected for this project due to its ability to handle complex datasets and non-linear relationships.
  * After hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV, the best model achieved a train score of 0.9756 and a test score of 0.8894.
  * The evaluation metric used was R-squared, with additional checks for MAE.
  * i am not used optimization technique because my model is good and save the model

Deployment :
Streamlit Application:
  * I The trained Random Forest model was deployed using Streamlit. 
  * The user can input key car features like mileage, fuel type, and engine displacement, and the app will return a predicted price for the used car.
